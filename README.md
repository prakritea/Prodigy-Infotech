TASK 1
MOVIE GENRE CLASSIFICATION
Create a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. You can use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines.

TASK 2
CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
Build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Use a dataset containing information about credit card transactions, and experiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or, legitimate. The Data used in the task is taken from kaggle as the link is provided by CodeSoft

TASK 4
SPAM SMS DETECTION
